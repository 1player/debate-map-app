# User reputation

## Overview

The reputation is similar to sites like StackOverflow: the more quality content you produce (as influenced, for example, by upvotes), the more privileges you receive on the site, and the more "weight" your votes have on node drafts and such.

A user with a verified email (required to make any contributions) starts out with a reputation of 1.
