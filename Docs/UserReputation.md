# User reputation

## Overview

The reputation is similar to sites like StackOverflow: the more quality content/decisions you make (for which upvotes/downvotes are a factor), the more privileges you receive on the site, and the more "weight" your votes have on node drafts and such.

The current plan is to have two component's as part of a user's reputation:
1) Approval count: The total number of users who have upvoted your content/decisions.
2) Approval percentage: The ratio of upvotes to downvotes (ie. upvotes / [upvotes + downvotes]).
Both values start at 0 for new users.

There are two prerequisites to gaining reputation:
1) User must have verified their email. (auto-verified if using Google sign-in)
2) User must have completed the "training" sequence. (details to-be-decided, but will likely involve explanations followed by multiple-choice-question quizzes)
