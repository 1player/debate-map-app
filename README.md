# Debate Map

Monorepo for the client, server, etc. of the Debate Map website ([debatemap.app](https://debatemap.app)).

> Note: The "master" branch of this repo is showing the codebase for the new monorepo setup, using [Postgraphile](https://github.com/graphile/postgraphile) for its database/backend rather than Firestore. It is still in development, so the <https://debatemap.app> website will have some discrepancies until this new version is ready and published.

# Overview

The [Debate Map](https://debatemap.app) project is a web platform aimed at improving the efficiency of discussion and debate. It's crowd-sourced and open-source, and welcomes reader contributions.

Its primary improvements are (in short):
* Restructuring dialogue to make use of both dimensions.
* Breaking down lines of reasoning into single-sentence "nodes".
* Providing rich tools that operate on those nodes -- such as rating, tagging, statistical analysis, and belief-tree sharing and comparison.

The maps are constructed from "claims" (blue), and "arguments" (green and red) which support/oppose those claims. This structure cuts down on reading time, and lets us focus on the underlying chains of reasoning instead of parsing statement meanings and connections.

## General

### [setup-general] General repo setup

1) Ensure [NodeJS](https://nodejs.org) (v14.13.0+) is installed, as well as [Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/getting-started/migration) (needed for Yarn workspaces).
2) Clone/download this repo to disk. (https://github.com/debate-map/app.git)
3) Install this repo's dependencies by running: `yarn install`
4) [temp] Fix the typing issue in recharts `node_modules/recharts/types/polar/Radar.d.ts`, replacing the `<P, T>` sections with `<any, any>`.

### [vscode] VSCode window setup

Prerequisite steps: [setup-general](https://github.com/debate-map/app#setup-general)

It's recommended to split your dev setup into two vscode windows:
1) Window #1 in the `Packages` folder. Use this window to open files in `Packages/client`. (opening files in `Packages/common` is also fine)
2) Window #2 in the repo root, for everything else. (server development, deployment, etc.)

Reasons:
* About half of the development work is done in `Packages/client`, since it is the "driver" of most changes/functionality. And having the workload split between the two windows (by "area of concern"), helps maintain tab-count sanity, and clarity of where a given file/tab should be located.
* A separate `tasks.json` file has been set up for the two folders, so having vscode windows open in them both makes it is easier to follow the guide-module instructions. That said, a single vscode-window should work, but you'll need to reference the `tasks.json` or `package-scripts.js` files to manually run certain scripts/commands.
