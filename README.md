# Debate Map

Monorepo for the client, server, etc. of the Debate Map website ([debatemap.app](https://debatemap.app)).

> Note: The "master" branch of this repo is showing the codebase for the new monorepo setup, using [Postgraphile](https://github.com/graphile/postgraphile) for its database/backend rather than Firestore. It is still in development, so the <https://debatemap.app> website will have some discrepancies until this new version is ready and published.

# Overview

The [Debate Map](https://debatemap.app) project is a web platform aimed at improving the efficiency of discussion and debate. It's crowd-sourced and open-source, and welcomes reader contributions.

Its primary improvements are (in short):
* Restructuring dialogue to make use of both dimensions.
* Breaking down lines of reasoning into single-sentence "nodes".
* Providing rich tools that operate on those nodes -- such as rating, tagging, statistical analysis, and belief-tree sharing and comparison.

The maps are constructed from "theses" (blue) which make claims, and "arguments" (green and red) which support/oppose those claims. This structure cuts down on reading time, and lets us focus on the underlying chains of reasoning instead of parsing statement meanings and connections.

# Development

## Setup

### Part 1 (general)

1) Ensure [NodeJS](https://nodejs.org) (v14.13.0+) is installed, as well as [Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/getting-started/migration) (needed for Yarn workspaces).

2) Clone/download this repo to disk. (https://github.com/debate-map/app.git)

3) Install this repo's dependencies by running: `yarn`

4) Provide valid targets for the Yarn "portals" (ie. package symlinks). Inspect the "resolutions" field in the root `package.json` to know where to clone/install the symlinked packages.

### Part 2 (client)

5) Follow the instructions here: <https://github.com/debate-map/app/tree/master/Packages/client#setup>

### Part 3 (server)

> This part is only necessary if you're making changes to the backend, or otherwise want to run your own server instance.

6) Follow the instructions here: <https://github.com/debate-map/app/tree/master/Packages/server#setup>

## Editing + running

1) It's recommended to open two VSCode windows:
   * The first in the `Packages/client` folder, for the ui and other frontend code.
   * The second in the repo root, for everything else. (helps separate the concerns/contexts into roughly two halves)
2) In vscode #1, start frontend ts-compiler: ctrl+shift+b, then `#1 tsc`.
3) In vscode #1, start frontend webpack/dev-server: ctrl+shift+b, then `#2 webpack`.
4) In vscode #2, start backend compiler: ctrl+shift+b, then `#1 server.dev`.
5) In vscode #2, start db-shape tracker: ctrl+shift+b, then `#2 server.trackDBShape`.
6) In vscode #2, start backend: ctrl+shift+b, then `#3 server.run`.
7) Open website locally at: `localhost:3005`
