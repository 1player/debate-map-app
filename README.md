# Debate Map

Monorepo for the client, server, etc. of the Debate Map website ([debatemap.app](https://debatemap.app)).

> Note: The "master" branch of this repo is showing the codebase for the new monorepo setup, using [Postgraphile](https://github.com/graphile/postgraphile) for its database/backend rather than Firestore. It is still in development, so the <https://debatemap.app> website will have some discrepancies until this new version is ready and published.

# Overview

The [Debate Map](https://debatemap.app) project is a web platform aimed at improving the efficiency of discussion and debate. It's crowd-sourced and open-source, and welcomes reader contributions.

Its primary improvements are (in short):
* Restructuring dialogue to make use of both dimensions.
* Breaking down lines of reasoning into single-sentence "nodes".
* Providing rich tools that operate on those nodes -- such as rating, tagging, statistical analysis, and belief-tree sharing and comparison.

The maps are constructed from "theses" (blue) which make claims, and "arguments" (green and red) which support/oppose those claims. This structure cuts down on reading time, and lets us focus on the underlying chains of reasoning instead of parsing statement meanings and connections.

## General

<!----><a name="setup-general"></a>
### [setup-general] General repo setup

1) Ensure [NodeJS](https://nodejs.org) (v14.13.0+) is installed, as well as [Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/getting-started/migration) (needed for Yarn workspaces).
2) Clone/download this repo to disk. (https://github.com/debate-map/app.git)
3) Install this repo's dependencies by running: `yarn install`
4) [temp] Fix the typing issue in recharts `node_modules/recharts/types/polar/Radar.d.ts`, replacing the `<P, T>` sections with `<any, any>`.

<!----><a name="vscode"></a>
### [vscode] VSCode window setup

Prerequisite steps: [setup-general](https://github.com/debate-map/app#setup-general)

1) Open one VSCode window in the `Packages` folder, for the ui and other frontend code. (different folders mainly just so they can have/keep separate tab-sets)
2) Open a second VSCode window in the repo root, for everything else. (helps separate the concerns/contexts into roughly two halves)
